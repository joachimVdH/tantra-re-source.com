# Energetic treatment 

In an energetic treatment prana will be generated to approach a theme you wish to address with a customised and discussed treatment. With the generated prana, we can work in various ways.  

Possible methods: 

* <a href="#PranaActivaties">Prana activation</a>  
* <a href="#ChakraAuraBalancing">Chakra- and aura Balancing </a>  
* <a href="#DrukpuntMassage">pressure point massage (acupressure)  </a> 
* <a href="#KristalBehandeling">crystal healing </a>
* <a href="#ZweedseMassage">Swedish (sports) massage</a>
* <a href="#EnergetischeZuivering">Energetic cleansing</a>


<h1 id="PranaActivaties"> Prana activation </h1>

Once prana is activated, energy channels are cleansed and one is able to connect to the own energy system. As indicated before on this website (section tantra), this is done by activating the own “spiritual motor”.  


Prana activations are possible in various ways:

* Based on Tibetan tantra massage and Japanese pressure point massage
* Crystal healing adapted to prana activation as theme
* Breathe work, with or without additional (pressure point) massage 
* Other methods not offered by Re-Source (feel free to ask more info)


In fact, prana is generated in all massage forms. Nevertheless, in specifically chosen prana activation we will work a lot more profound and conscious towards waking up the energy, while in other massage sessions the energy is free to flow where it is needed. This will manifest in a much longer, more intense massage then the other treatments.  


<h1 id="ChakraAuraBalancing"> Chakra- and aura Balancing </h1>

The aura is an electromagnetic field that is shaped by energies running through the body. This field can be disrupted by other electromagnetic influences, such as what we eat, drink, stress, emotions, electricity, cell phones, and many other influential factors. In an aura balancing or chakra balancing these fields will be charged with prana, and create space for your aura to find its natural state so more energy can flow freely through them again and support your healing process. 

In a chakra balancing, more focused attention will be put into charging the chakras. In fact the body has an infinite number of chakras, but according to ancient systems there are some specific locations where the “main chakras” reside. In their natural state, one could see them as turning discs and when they turn around at their normal pace, the energy is free to pass through them. In a chakra balancing specific attention is given to themes that are important to you and their impact on the specific chakras that are influenced by it. 

<h1 id="DrukpuntMassage"> Pressure point massage </h1>

In a pressure point massage the meridian system is approached by specific pressure points. However in any massage form we work on certain meridians, we follow in pressure point massage the main meridian system according to the Eastern methodology. According to Eastern methodology, the organs and the different meridian systems are nourished and balanced through specific battery points and meridian points. As a consequence, this leads to a higher immunity and increased ability to recover.     


<h1 id="KristalBehandeling"> Crystal Healing </h1>

A crystal healing can be compared to previously explained methods such as acupressure, chakra balancing or aura balancing. Nevertheless it is a lot more intense because the generated energy (prana) is purified and focused through laser crystals. As a result, it facilitates a more profound penetration of the energy system at specific points. Similarly to above mentioned treatments, in a crystal healing we can focus on specific meridians, chakras and the aura. A crystal healing can be combined with other forms of massage.  


<h1 id="ZweedseMassage"> Swedish (sports) massage </h1>

A relaxation massage can contribute to maintaining health both physically as mentally. The goal is to release daily stress in body and mind so the body can experience true relaxation again. It is possible to have only a part of the body treated such as the back, neck, head, shoulders, legs or arms. The massage is performed with massage oil on the bare skin. The difference between a Swedish and sports massage is the tempo of the strokes.


<h1 id="EnergetischeZuivering">Energetic cleansing</h1>

An energetic cleansing can be done for various reasons. Often we feel strange energies in our homes, or some objects can carry heavy energies. An energetic cleanse is intended to create space for new energies by resetting the energy in a certain place or object. Old attachments can be released and make room for new energies. This is also possible on “company level” but that is out of the scope of Re-Source. Cleansings are offered in customised form and decided in agreement with the client. The scope of Re-Source is limite to cleansing houses and objects.
