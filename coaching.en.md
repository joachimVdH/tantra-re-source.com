<h1 id="IntimiteitsRelationeleCoaching"> Intimacy- and relational coaching  </h1>

The purpose of intimacy- and relational coaching is to guide the process of growth between couples and allow (more) love and consciousness in the connection. Tools such as engaged communication, tantric yoga, tantric communication, meditation, cosmic orbit work, breath work and more are applied to create a solid base to a greater intimacy. Furthermore it is possible to deepen sexuality with the tools offered by Re-Source. 

The deepest intimacy (including with ourselves) is that which comes into existence when all fears to completely show ourselves in full vulnerability fall away, and we can hold the required space to one another for this process. It also means that we learn to handle “what is” differently and as a consequence obstacles become tools to transformation. From the space of full acceptance, in observation of the own emotional states but without following them, love can flow freely and become the tool towards transformation.

### Ask for a free demo for your company 

#### An Ancient Tantra Kriya Yoga demo session of +-2 hours could be given for free to showcase how it works before you decide whether or not this coaching technique is interesting to your company.

In this coaching method we strive towards leadership from the connection with the heart. The goal of management coaching is to facilitate the process of growth between manager(s), employees, and “the company” and as a consequence allow leadership from love and strengths. With tools such as engaged communication, tantric yoga, tantric communication, meditation, cosmic orbit work and breathe work, the base can be built to a more heart centered approach. Consequently, the company can operate more conscious to society and connect to the true needs of both employees and society.  

Breathe work and tantric yoga contribute to the common welfare and centering, and can be a very powerful tool to make important decisions as they clear the system from stress and limitations of the mind. Because of the fact that applying tantric yoga principles has the potential to calm down the flow of thoughts in only minutes, it is a unique Re-Source to apply because of the time frame managers are usually confronted with.

Furthermore tantric yoga suits group work between colleagues perfectly, with or without executives, depending on the themes worked on. It is a unique tool to apply in team building activities because as mentioned in the section “tantric yoga” it can lead to a connection between people very fast, independent of emotions and inhibitions because of the fact that conflict energies are approached in a non-verbal way. It includes that we learn to handle “what is” differently. This way, obstacles become tools to transformation. From the space of (self-)acceptance, observing the own emotions without following them, love can flow and form the base to transformation. This creates space to indicate during a verbal phase what the challenges are underway to a connected cooperation.
