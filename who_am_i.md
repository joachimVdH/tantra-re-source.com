# Who am I

__Siegfried Présent (40) is a tantra intstructor and (tantra welness) masseur.__ 


He grew up in a family that has always been attracted to personal development and spirituality. In this environment, self development and grow were strongly encouraged. Because of the fact that his mom and dad were passionate by Eastern philosophy, his father became tai chi teacher [EddyPresent.be](http://www.eddypresent.be) and his mother a daily practitioner of active meditation, yoga, breathwork, etc. As a result, he went seeking for himself.  


He recently graduated cum laude from the “Rasayana Tantra Academy” and the instructor training “Ancient Tantra Kriya Yoga” level I. Further more, he graduated as cosmetic masseur (Swedish and sport massage). This list is completed by the fact that he followed some other modular courses such as Shiatsu, chair massage, engaged communication and more. Last but not least, he keeps visiting his Ashram, to keep developing himself on energetical level. Today he feels ready to support other people in their spiritual journey en exchange knowledge in workshops, coaching sessions, tantra lessons and (tantric) personalised treatments.
